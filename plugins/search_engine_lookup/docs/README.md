# Search Engine Lookup \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/search_engine_lookup/search_engine_lookup.zip)\]

## Overview

This plugin adds a right click option on a cluster, providing the ability to lookup the cluster using a search engine in a browser window.
When you right-click on a cluster, the option is found under the "Plugins" section of the context list.

## Settings

A settings screen is available in Picard's options settings, under the Plugins section.  This allows the user to select their preferred
search engine provider, and any additional words to provide with the search.  You can also add, edit or remove search engine providers.
