# Bob Swift's MusicBrainz Picard Plugins

This branch of the picard-plugins repository hosts plugins for [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) that have been developed by Bob Swift (rdswift).  Not all of these plugins have been submitted to the [musicbrainz/picard-plugins](https://github.com/musicbrainz/picard-plugins) repository.  Some have been developed for personal use, and some specialty plugins have been developed on request or in response to discussion in the [MetaBrainz Community Forum](https://community.metabrainz.org/).

Note that all plugins in this branch of the repository are released under the GNU General Public License version 2 ("GPL") or a license compatible with it. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html for a list of compatible licenses.

## Data Dumper \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/data_dumper/data_dumper.py)\]

This plugin saves the output for the track and release metadata to a text file.  By default, the file is called 'data_dump.txt' and it is saved in the file naming destination directory.

This can be used to help develop release and track plugins by providing a log of the information passed to the plugin.

-------

## Format Performer Tags \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/format_performer_tags/format_performer_tags.zip)\]

This plugin allows the user to configure the way that instrument and vocal performer tags are written. Once
installed a settings page will be added to Picard's options, which is where the plugin is configured.

Please see the [user guide](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/blob/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/format_performer_tags/docs/README.md) for more information.

-------

## Get Eval Function \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/get_eval/get_eval.zip)\]
This plugin provides a new scripting function `$get_eval()` that allows the user to evaluate specified python code within Picard and return the results as a string for use within scripts.

This allows access to all metadata fields and the ability to use native python processing commands directly from a script without having to create and load additional plugins. 

Please see the [user guide](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/blob/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/get_eval/README.md) for more information.

-------

## Performer Tag Replace \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/performer_tag_replace/performer_tag_replace.zip)\]

This plugin provides the ability to replace text in performer tags. Once installed a settings page will be
added to Picard's options, which is where the plugin is configured.

Please see the [user guide](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/blob/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/performer_tag_replace/docs/README.md) for more information.

-------

## Release Language Title \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/release_language_title/release_language_title.py)\]

This plugin provides full language title for the release as a variable (_releaselanguagetitle) for use in naming scripts.  See the [discussion](https://community.metabrainz.org/t/help-with-file-naming-with-special-rule-for-soundtracks/398631) on the MetaBrainz Community Forum.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Tagger scripts are required to make use of this hidden variable.
