# Performer Tag Replace \[[Download](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-plugins/raw/2.0_RDS_Plugins/plugins/performer_tag_replace/performer_tag_replace.zip)\]

## Overview

This plugin provides the ability to replace text in performer tags. Once installed a settings page will be
added to Picard's options, which is where the plugin is configured.

---

## Settings

The settings panel allows the user to provide a list of the original/replacement pairs used to modify the keys
for the performer tags. Each pair must be entered on a separate line in the form:

```
original character string=replacement character string
```

Blank lines and lines beginning with an equals sign (=) will be ignored. Replacements will be made in the
order they are found in the list.

There is also a setting which allows the user to choose whether or not to apply the replacements to the artist
values in addition to the instrument / vocal keys.  By default, only the keys are processed.

## Examples

### Example 1:

Suppose that you don't like instruments listed as "instrument family", but would rather have it shown as
the plural of the instrument.  This could be done using the following:

```
==========================================
= Remove "family" from instrument groups =
==========================================
s family=ses
 family=s
```

Note that the last line begins with a single space.

This would cause the performer credit `Performer [guitar family]: Chet Atkins` to be changed to `Performer [guitars]: Chet Atkins`.

Note that the `s family=ses` would match an instrument family where the instrument ended in "s" and add
"es" rather than just an "s".  For example if there was a "bass family", this would change it to "basses"
rather than "basss".  (As of this writing, I don't think there are any cases in the database where the
instrument in an instrument family ends with an "s", so that replacement pair should never be triggered.)


### Example 2:

Suppose that you don't like the term "additional", but would rather have it shown as "extra".  This could
be done using the following:

```
==================================
= Change "additional" to "extra" =
==================================
additional=extra
```

This would cause the performer credit `Performer [additional background vocals]: Jeen` to be
changed to `Performer [extra background vocals]: Jeen`.


### Example 3:

Suppose that you want to show the instrument as "drums" rather than "drums (drum set)", or "membranophone".
This could be done using the following:

```
=====================================
= Standardize instrument to "drums" =
=====================================
drums (drum set)=drums
drum set=drums
membranophone=drums
```

This would cause the performer credit `Performer [membranophone]: Ringo Starr` to be changed to
`Performer [drums]: Ringo Starr`.

the development of this plugin, and for providing the write-up and examples that formed the basis for this User Guide.



## Description

This plugin allows the user to configure the way that instrument and vocal performer tags are written. Once
installed a settings page will be added to Picard's options, which is where the plugin is configured.

These settings will determine the format for any Performer tags prepared. The format is divided into six
parts: the performer; the instrument or vocals; and four user selectable sections for the extra
information. This is set out as:

\[Section 1\]Instrument/Vocals\[Section 2\]\[Section 3\]: Performer\[Section 4\]

You can select the section in which each of the extra information words appears.  These extra information
words are "additional", "guest", "solo" and type of vocal.

For each of the sections you can select the starting character(s), the character(s) separating entries, and
the ending character(s).  Note that leading or trailing spaces must be included in the settings and will not
be automatically added.  If no separator characters are entered, the items will be automatically separated
by a single space.

Note that sections that don't contain any entries for a givien performer tag will not be included in the
tag, including any start or end text configured for the section.

For example, some of the ways that a performer relationship for Billy Preston playing a guest solo on the
Rhodes piano could be configured to be saved include:

* Performer [guest solo rhodes piano]: Billy Preston
* Performer [solo rhodes piano]: Billy Preston (guest)
* Performer [rhodes piano]: Billy Preston (guest solo)
* Performer [rhodes piano, guest solo]: Billy Preston
* Performer [rhodes piano, solo]: Billy Preston (guest)
* Performer [rhodes piano, guest]: Billy Preston (solo)

This shows only a few examples of the many possible displays that can be configured.

## Settings

The first group of settings is the **Keyword Section Assignments**.  This is where you select the section in
which each of the keywords will be displayed.  Selection is made by clicking the radio button corresponding
to the desired section for each of the keywords.

The second group of settings is the **Section Display Settings**.  This is where you configure the text
included at the beginning and end of each section displayed, and the characters used to separate multiple
items within a section.  Note that leading or trailing spaces must be included in the settings and will not
be automatically added.  If no separator characters are entered, the items will be automatically separated
by a single space.

The initial default settings are:

```
Keyword 'additional':  Section 3
Keyword 'guest':       Section 4
Keyword 'solo':        Section 3
All 'vocals' keywords: Section 2

Section 1 starting text:   ''
Section 1 ending text:     ''
Section 1 separator text:  ''

Section 2 starting text:   ', '
Section 2 ending text:     ''
Section 2 separator text:  ''

Section 3 starting text:   ' ('
Section 3 ending text:     ''
Section 3 separator text:  ')'

Section 4 starting text:   ' ('
Section 4 ending text:     ''
Section 4 separator text:  ')'
```

These settings will produce tags such as:

* Performer [rhodes piano (solo)]: Billy Preston (guest)
* Performer [percussion]: Steve Berlin (guest), Kris MacFarlane, SÃ©an McCann
* Performer [vocal, background]: Jeen (guest)
