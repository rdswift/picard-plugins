# Language Name

This plugin provides a new scripting function `$language_name()` that allows the user to retrieve the full name for a three-character language code.  The function is available to both user scripts and file naming scripts.

## Usage

The function is used as `$language_name(code)`, where `code` is the three-character language code.  It will typically be used to expand the `%language%` and `%_releaselanguage%` tags.

By default, the language used for the return values will be based on the user's interface language set in the Picard options.  This can be overridden in the 'Scripting'->'Language Name' section of Picard's options settings.

For example, assuming the user interface is set to english and has not been overridden in the settings, `$language_name(%language%)` will return '**English**' if the language code is '**eng**', or '**GwichÂ´in**' if the language code is '**gwi**', or even '**Klingon / tlhIngan-Hol**' if the code is '**tlh**'. (Yes, Klingon is actually officially recognized in the ISO 639-3 list of languages.)

If an unknown code is entered, the function will return '**unknown**'.  If there is no code entered, '**missing**' will be returned.

## Supported Languages for Return Values

Languages currently supported are English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Russian and Chinese.  Note that some translations may be incorrect or incomplete.

English is the output language used for all user interface languages not currently supported.

Any help correcting / completing the current translations, or translation to other languages would be appreciated.

## Technical Notes

This function uses a subset of the ISO 639-3 language codes as found on the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes) website.

The selected language code table is loaded the first time the function is used.  Each time the function is called, it checks whether the language selection has changed.  If it has been changed in the option settings, the new language code table is loaded to replace the current code table.
