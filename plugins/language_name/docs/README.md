# Language Name

This plugin provides a new scripting function `$language_name()` that allows the user to retrieve the full name for a three-character language code.  The function is available to both user scripts and file naming scripts.

## Usage

The function is used as `$language_name(code)`, where `code` is the three-character language code.  It will typically be used to expand the `%language%` and `%_releaselanguage%` tags.

By default, the language used for the return values will be based on the user's interface language set in the Picard options.  This can be overridden in the 'Scripting'->'Language Name' section of Picard's options settings.

For example, assuming the user interface is set to english and has not been overridden in the settings, `$language_name(%language%)` will return '**English**' if the language code is '**eng**', or '**GwichÂ´in**' if the language code is '**gwi**', or even '**Klingon / tlhIngan-Hol**' if the code is '**tlh**'. (Yes, Klingon is actually officially recognized in the ISO 639-3 list of languages.)

If an unknown code is entered, the function will return '**unknown**'.  If there is no code entered, '**missing**' will be returned.

### Tutorial

The following usage tutorial has been graciously provided by ***hiccup***:

You will need to use a script to tag your files with the full language names that this plugins makes available.  A basic script to e.g. populate the 'language' tag with the full language name of the work could be:

```
$set(language,$language_name(%language%))
```

Or if you want to write the release language, you could use:

```
$set(release language,$language_name(%_releaselanguage%))
```

By default, when a release has no language code attached to it, the plugin will populate a tag with the text "**missing**".  If for these cases you don't want a tag created at all, you could use a script like this:

```
$set(language_temp,$language_name(%language%))
$if($in(%language_temp%,missing),,$set(language,%language_temp%))
$delete(language_temp)
```

When a release has the code "**zxx**", the plugin will write "**no linguistic content**".  While technically correct, you might prefer to have "**Instrumental**" in your tags instead.  Integrated with the previous example script, you then could use:

```
$set(language_temp,$language_name(%language%))
$if($in(%language_temp%,missing),,$if($in(%language_temp%,no linguistic content),$set(language,Instrumental),$set(language,%language_temp%)))
$delete(language_temp)
```

If you are using a language other than English, you should change "no linguistic content" accordingly. E.g. for Dutch you should use:

```
$set(language_temp,$language_name(%language%))
$if($in(%language_temp%,missing),,$if($in(%language_temp%,geen taalkundige inhoud),$set(language,Instrumentaal),$set(language,%language_temp%)))
$delete(language_temp)
```

## Supported Languages for Return Values

Languages currently supported are English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Russian and Chinese.  Note that some translations may be incorrect or incomplete.

English is the output language used for all user interface languages not currently supported.

Any help correcting / completing the current translations, or translation to other languages would be appreciated.

## Technical Notes

This function uses a subset of the ISO 639-3 language codes as found on the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes) website.

The selected language code table is loaded the first time the function is used.  Each time the function is called, it checks whether the language selection has changed.  If it has been changed in the option settings, the new language code table is loaded to replace the current code table.
