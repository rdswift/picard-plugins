# MusicBrainz Picard Plugins

This branch of the picard-plugins repository hosts plugins for [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) that have been developed by Bob Swift (rdswift).  Not all of these plugins have been submitted to the [musicbrainz/picard-plugins](https://github.com/musicbrainz/picard-plugins) repository.  Some have been developed for personal use, and some specialty plugins have been developed on request or in response to discussion in the [MetaBrainz Community Forum](https://community.metabrainz.org/).

Note that all plugins in this branch of the repository are released under the GNU General Public License version 2 ("GPL") or a license compatible with it. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html for a list of compatible licenses.
